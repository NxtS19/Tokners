                <h1>Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.</h1>
                <p>We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and creators being able to launch
                    their own digital currency by simply creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible
                    Tokens that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network</p>

                    <h4>For Creators</h4>
                    <p>Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system that is dependent
                        on
                        growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
                        value of the tokens minted.</p>

                    <p>Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits including unreleased
                        content,
                        private communities, direct access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as
                        the
                        ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with
                        early
                        token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers.</p>

                        <br> We would get
                        them
                        on our platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where
                        their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary
                        value of
                        their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across
                        their
                        channels while our native token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.

                        some countries and
                        entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                        holding
                        the fort. </b> <br><br> Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
                    launched all aiming
                    to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
                    adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity
                    can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social
                    currency of their favourite person and watch their investment as is with other crypto currency
                    project. <br> <br>We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent
                    retail
                    investors". We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to
                    understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of
                    people to finally give this space a real look. <br><br>
                    <b>A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators would
                        be
                        paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer. </b> <br><br> There
                    would be new
                    markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said, <br><br>
                    "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them". <br><br>
                    Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say. <br><br>
                    Currency is
                    digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead presidents on
                    the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it because it would make the
                    most sense in the world.
